# Pokémon Re-Energized Emerald

## This is a WIP ROMhack. If you are reading this text, then know that many of the following features have not yet been implemented

This is a "redux" version of LandOfChocolate's excellent Energized Emerald ROMhack. It adopts a design philosophy which builds upon and extends the changes existing in Energized Emerald, and adds more ideas from the remixer, a longtime fan of the the "Pokebilities" tier on Pokemon SHowdown.

This remixed version of Energized Emerald does not seek to be a true clone of the Pokebilities ladder, and instead is intended to make concessions so as to improve the single-player experience.

### Differences from Pokebilities:
- Most "drawback abilities" have been either removed, or extremely reduced in distribution.
  - This applies to many Weak Armor mons, such as Skarmory and Onix.
  - It does not apply to Truant Slaking, as Truant is too much a part of Slaking's identity.
- Abilities which increase variability, such as evasion-enhancing abilities, or random stat changes, have been removed.
  - This was largely implemented by LandOfChocolate in the original Energized Emerald, such as by changing Sand Veil and Snow Cloak to provide defensive boosts, rather than evasive boosts.
  - Tangling Feet has been removed from all obtainable mons.
  - Moody has been removed from all obtainable mons.
  - Anger Point will be reworked into Stamina, but for the attack stat instead of for defense.
  - As a rare exception, Spinda retains "Unsteady" from Enegized Emerald. This is a flavor-based design decision, as Spinda is embraced as a gimmick Pokemon, and is not overpowered.
- Land-based Pokemon whose animations grant them the appearance of levitating, or who are said to float in Pokemon lore, now (mostly) possess Levitate
  - This is very intuitive in practice - if a mon floats or flies in the 3D games, and that "floating" is not merely symbolizing that the mon is swimming, then you may expect it to levitate and be immune to Ground moves.
  - Energized Emerald included the majority of these new Levitate mons already, but more still have been added for Re-energized.
  - This also functions as a mild nerf to Ground attacks.
- A very small number of mons in Pokebilities are overpowered, even by the higher power level expected in Pokebilities. Several of these mons have had *some* of their abilities changed.
  - Porygon-Z no longer receives its infamous trifecta of Adaptability, Download, and Analytic.
  - Conkeldurr was a bit too much with all of Guts, Sheer Force, and Iron Fist.
  - A few others have received minor ability nerfs, while still remaining reasonably faithful to their original gameplan.

### Differences from Energized Emerald
- The Mega Ring will become accessible to the player at a time in the story similar to that of ORAS. The remaining gameplay after accessing mega eveolution will be balanced accordingly.
- Many moves which rendered mons powerful in Pokebilities which are not accessible until the post-game in Energized Emerald will now be accessible late in the story, but prior to the Elite 4.
- A number of maps previously accessible only in the post-game are now accessible during the main story, in large part for the purpose of expanding the available pool of mons without making each route feel overcrowded.
- A small number of new routes will be added, both for the purpose of expanding the pool of available mons, and for the purpose of fleshing out map progression further.
- The challenge level will be increase from the "Vanilla+" Emerald of Energized Emerald to a midground between a difficulty hack and the base game. The goals are as follows:
  - To an experienced player who is operating a normal playthrough, this will feel engaging, but not challenging.
  - To a casual player, who has never played a difficulty hack, this will feel somewhat challenging, but not intimidatingly so.
  - To an experienced player who is running a nuzzlocke, this game will feel just *slightly* challenging.
  - To a player who is running a nuzzlocke with extra-difficult self-imposed rules, or to a player with little experience playing nuzzlock challenges, this game may be feel substantially challenging.
- The prices of some PokeMart items will be adjusted, in order to reflect the fact that items cannot be used in trainer battles.
- The experience curve will be adjusted, such that experience points will feel like more of a precious resource, similar to the pre-Generation 6 games.
  - This will be done in order to enhance the value of sticking with the same team members, by increasing the trade-off of swapping them out for new catches.
  - As this is not intended as a difficulty hack, level progression will be emphasized as one of the tangible measures of effort and progress the player puts into the game.
 
### Differences from both Pokebilities and Energized Emerald
- Energized Emergald was very limited in its stat changes. Re-energized is *somewhat* more liberal with stat changes.
- Very, *very* few mons in the mid-speed and high-speed tiers have had any speed base stat adjustments. Your memorization of speed tiers may be safely re-used for Re-Energized Emerald.
  - This does not apply to mons which are already slow. A larger number of slow mons with surprisingly disappointing bulk have had their bulk vs speed ratio min-maxxed a little further.
- A number of mons with the "Hoenn Special" stat spread have traded one of their mixed offensive stats for a defensive stat buff.
  - This includes some mons which didn't debut in Hoenn, such as Flareon, which trades its 95 base special attack for its 65 base HP.
  - Whenever feasible, the speed stat was avoided when making such swaps.
- Several mons who have terrible offensive stats on both sides have received modest min-maxxing into a preferred offensive stat, as a concession to help make these mons more enjoyable to use in a playthrough.
  - An example of this is Probopass, which drains some of its attack stat in order to achieve an acceptable special attack stat to wield Flash Canon, Power Gem, Thunderbolt, and the like.
- Whenever two Pokemon would have an overlapping role in such a stat change, concessions have been made in order to help differentiate the two.
  - Cacturne and Shiftry were two Pokemon with the Hoenn Special.
    - Cacturne has become a physically-based Grass/Dark mon, and remains slow,
	- Shiftry has kepts its special attack, but swapped its physical attack and defense, and stays fast enough to take advantage of Chlorophyll.
  - Victreebel, Vileplume, and Venusaur have all had overlapping roles since the first generation
    - Venusaur leans into Chlorophyll, as the fastest of the three, and a mon who has been identified closely with Solar Beam since the series' conception.
    - Vileplume trades out Chlorophyll (partly for lore reasons) to emphasize draining moves, with its design modeled after a parasitic plant.
    - Victreebel swaps its special attack and speed, in order to emphasize its physical orientation, and its abilities now reflect the fact that its animations have it levitating.
  - Crawdaunt already had a niche as a Choice Band attacker, particularly under Trick Room, but Kingler has been left by the wayside.
    - Crawdaunt trades its special attack and special defense, to help it tank resisted Shadow Balls
    - Kingler min-maxes some of its special attack for higher physical defense, and Crabhammer can now benefit from Sheer Force.
- A small number of mons have received type changes, which it was difficult to think of how else to meaningfully help them stand out from other similar mons
  - Politoed is now Water/Normal with Volume Up.
  - Kantonian Ninetales is now Fire/Fairy, mirroring its Alolan form.
  - Donphan updated to Ground/Fighting, influenced by its past paradox form.
  - Altaria is now Dragon/Fairy, like its mega evolution.
  - Blissey is now Normal/Fairy, in order to further differentiate it from Eviolite Chansey.
- There are two types which have received type chart rebalancing
  - Rock now resists itself. This doesn't mean much for the various Rock/Ground types, but it helps out some mons like Armaldo, Magcargo, or Aurorus
  - Ice has gained resistances to Ghost, Fairy, and Water. It is now immune to itself.
    - Ghost attacks had excessively good neutral coverage and needed a minor nerf.
    - Ice resisted Fairy in the beta for X/Y. This resurrects that type relationship, while mildly nerfing the excellent Fairy type.
    - Water attacks have excellent neutral coverage, and are common enough to give Ice types a useful defensive role in a playthrough.
      - This partciular change could end up being controversial, and may potentially be reverted.
      - The end goal is such that Ice types will feel similar to Fire or Grass - not an outright *bad* defensive type, but one which possesses substantial common weaknesses, which aren't quite fully compensated by the resistances.
    - Immunity to Ice attacks helps nerf the already-excellent offensive prowess of Ice moves, while additionally providing a meaningul buff to any Ice types which did not previously resist Ice, like Abomasnow and Articuno.
- Slightly fewer mons have extraneous weather abilities, especially Leaf Guard and Chlorophyll
  - Some mons who have kept their weather abilities have received *additional* abilities which complement their weather-abusing identity. Examples include:
  - Floatzel: Previously had just Swift Swim, but it now gets Hydration as well.
  - Venusaur: Both Chlorophyll and the slightly-nerfed Solar Power
  - Beartic: Already had both Slush Rush and Snow Veil, but it formerly had the non-complementary Swift Swim as well. Now it has the trifecta of Slush Rush, Snow Veil, and Ice Body.
  - Hippowdon: It already had both Sand Stream and Sand Force, but it now gains Sand Veil
- Slightly larger number of mons with weather-setting abilities are now available
  - Pidgeot and Rotom-Fan are now the non-legendary setters of Strong Winds.
  - Sunflora and Houndoom stand in as the non-legendary Desolate Land wielders.
  - Golisopod and Lapras gain access to Primordial Sea
  - Cacturne now gains Sand Stream
  - Ludicolo is the new Drizzle user
  - Centiskorch becomes the new Drought user


## Original Energized Emerald Readme:

Pokemon Energized Emerald is a revamp of Pokemon Emerald that offers an enhanced and expanded experience in gameplay, story, graphics and QoL whilst keeping with the themes of the original game. My changes aim to make the game more fun yet also providing a good fair challenge. It's intended to make an ultimate Pokemon Emerald experience and I've built it how I would want an ultimate Pokemon Emerald game to be. 

The biggest gameplay change in Energized Emerald is that Pokemon can now have up to 3 abilities working at once, creating more dynamic and strategic battles. Players will have to consider more mechanics bouncing about in battles than in regular Pokemon games and will also find that game balance has shifted, as many Pokemon have strongly benefitted (or not) from the multiple ability change. Some Pokemon gain abilities they didn't have before, like Gulpin who now has Corrosion, which also by the way is upgraded to now make Poison moves be super effective against Steel types! New abilities and moves have also been added to further improve on Pokemon themes and battle performance, Whismur does more damage with sound based moves with its new Volume Up ability and Gardevoir can use the new move Singularity to protect with black holes!
Outside of battles are many quality of life improvements. HMs are no longer required to teach to Pokemon to traverse obstacles, only the badge and a compatible Pokemon is required. Grinding has been significantly reduced with things like stronger vitamins, an IV buffing service, an EV maxing service, and buyable Rare Candies (for the post game), so making that perfect team takes much less time.
See the lists below for more extensive details of gameplay additions and updates.

The story has been revised with more ORAS elements, and it also continues after beating the Pokemon League with a brand new story! The overworld has been updated so players will see more bustling urban areas, more labyrinthian dungeons and also brand new areas containing Pokemon not found in the wild in vanilla Emerald which is tied to the post game story. Kyogre, Groudon and Rayquaza are tied to the post game story and can be encountered by following it.

The players will encounter the standard Hoenn dex in their playthrough (with some post gen evolutions like Budew and Dusknoir). Non-Hoenn Pokemon are available in the post game and organically found in entirely new areas or in cases like artificial Pokemon such as Porygon are bought.
All gen 1-3 Pokemon and their future evolutions and pre-evolutions are available in this game, for a total of 419 Pokemon. There are also 31 regional forms available, and some of them are accessible before post-game!

This is a rom hack of Pokemon Emerald using the pokeemerald-expansion decompilation project as its base: https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion.
The rom hack started in December 2021, using the version of pokeemerald-expansion at the time. Most updates to pokeemerald-expansion since then have been implemented in Energized Emerald. The game will continue to be updated to add or improve features and fix bugs.

# Post Launch TODOs

Possible future additions/changes.

- Labels for ability description and IV/EV stats in Pokemon summary screen.
- Pokedex to support regional variants.
- Pokedex to have other data as well. Moves, base stats, evolution requirements, abilities?
- Improve various art assets, mostly trainer pics.
- The berry trees of the type resist berries to have their own colours.
- Implement Zinnia's battle theme. Song is in game data, but not playing well. May be that I haven't figured out the right voicegroup or the song I chose isn't viable to use with GBA sound. Thing is, I know nothing about implementing music for the GBA. Violin sound samples have been added as well just for this song.
- Implement the multi-ability pop-up box in battles. The code is there, I just can't configure it right.
- A contest side-quest with Lisia, much like in ORAS.
- Perhaps a more interesting Tate & Liza event to get Jirachi?
- Scott giving more interesting rewards to players who get all silver/gold symbols.
- In-game resource that teaches the player braile. So that it isn't required to look out of the game to solve the braile puzzles.
- Sort out the online/wireless features. Either find out how to make them work or remove them.
- Better Game Corner games. May be a ton of work though. (Perhaps one could be a Battle Palace style battle where the Player places a bet?)
- Better Battle Frontier level scaling. Open level puts opponent Pokemon to your highest level Pokemon. Should scale all Pokemon to a certain level like the battle facilities in future gens.
- Make Origin moves use their own PP. PP reduction is done in Battle Script Commands and I currently can't think of a way to differentiate Origin moves and normal moves in `Cmd_ppreduce`. Origin moves not using their own PP is currently a "feature" until this problem can be solved.
- Add another star to the Trainer Card for completing the National Dex. Create a platinum colour scheme to go along with it.
- Named NPCs like Gym Leaders, Elite 4, Steven, etc to be possible partners in Battle Tower Multi challenge.
- A better way for Mirage Island to trigger?
- Add an Anything Goes challenge to the Battle Tower or as a new battle facility, where even Mega Evolutions and legendary Pokemon like Rayquaza are allowed.
- Obligatory beach episode.

# Known Bugs

Some of these may have been carried over from pokeemerald-expansion.

- Many switch-in abilities (like Frisk and Imposter) don’t activate when both Player Pokemon and opponent Pokemon fainted previous turn (e.g. Destiny Bond) and the Player sends out a Pokemon before the opponent sends out theirs. Solving this will probably involve having to rewrite the code that deals with switch-in abilities. This is probably the same behavior as in vanilla Pokemon Emerald, but I don't see why Trace and Intimidate are allowed to activate whilst others don't, so I'm considering this a bug.
- Abilities that activate at the same time as other abilities on the same Pokemon can have their names in the ability pop-up overwritten. (e.g. Tyranitar with Sand Stream and Unnerve). This is due to how switch-in (and other types) abilities are handled. This could be fixed by setting gLastUsedAbility during the ability battle script with the new setlastusedability command, but this freezes the game when used before calling the ability pop-up. Why? Have no fucking clue.
- Abilities that activate at the same time as other abilities can use wrong strings in the battle message.
- When Rattled is activated, the wrong ability is shown on the pop-up.
- Sometimes when Truant triggers, the wrong ability is shown on the pop-up.
- Intimidate may trigger on fainted Pokemon.
- Frisk may trigger on the wrong Pokemon. Often occurs in Battle Frontier.
- Arena Trap battle message when trying to switch doesn't show the ability string.
- Damp battle message when it by powder move doesn't show the ability string.
- When a Pokemon with Volt Absorb uses Ion Deluge, it triggers Volt Absorb.
- Stench ability may activate for opponent and not user. Scenario: Weezing vs Altaria, Altaria (no King's Rock) used Ice Beam which flinched Weezing, could be a bad gBattlerAttacker assignment or similar.
- Time Traveller ability ignores False Swipe effect of leaving the user with 1 HP.
- Bug Bite/Pluck is not taking the effects of the opponent's berry.
- Spinning Body activates on every hit for multi-hit moves (e.g. Hitmontop using Triple Kick). Would rather it takes affect on only the last hit.
- Backgrounds of some moves are glitched or have black boxes. (Shadow Bone, Gunk Shot, Hurricane, Focus Blast, Aura Sphere, Burn Up, Origin Pulse)
- Cloud reflection can be seen in the long grass and trees in Route 120, as well as rocks in Crumbling Gorge.
- Jumping into long grass from ledge and moving produces incorrect grass animation.
- NPCs can change colour when picking items at BP exchange corner. Palette bug.
- Shop tiles change colour when in shop mode in Mauville sweet shop. Palette bug.
- In Contests of super rank and above, Pokemon sprites and NPC overworld sprites can get weird colours. Palette bug linked to too many NPCs on screen.
- When a Pokemon evolves by trading, an exp gain sound plays over the Pokemon's cry.
- When trading with the tradeback guy and you use a Pokemon with a different ID than your own (from in-game trade), the trade screen says you are trading with the Pokemon's previous owner.
- Wild Deoxys may not regenerate HP bar properly in battle. This is just visual, actual HP values are there. Repeatedly occurs when KOing it from 100% HP.
- Deoxys is also supposed to use a form change animation when changing forms, but it isn't working at all.
- Deoxys may also skip a form change. Repeatedly occurs with Draining Kiss.
- Origin move selection has a visual cursor bug when normal moves are selected, cursor selects 3rd or 4th move, return to main fight menu and then choose Origin move.
- Some Pokemon in PC boxes have the top left corner of their front sprite snipped off. (Dodrio, Alakazam, Kyogre, Lanturn, Aerodactyl, Flygon, Salamence and more)
- Move relearner doesn't list all of the possible moves to relearn, only the first ~15.

# Frequently Asked Questions/Troubleshooting

- The ROM doesn't patch
There are other downloads on the Pokemon Energized Emerald Discord server to try. Make sure you're using a Trashman Pokemon Emerald ROM. 

- The game crashes during the introduction
This is an emulator issue and I don't know why this happens. Try a different core on your emulator or a different emulator. I've had success with mBGA, Virtual Boy Advance and Pizza Boy on Android.

- How do I put the game onto a cartridge?
I have absolutely no idea. I don't even know if it's possible for pokeemeerald-expansion projects. 

- Cheats don't work!
Yeah, not surprising. The format of the save file has been changed. Don't ask me to make cheats because I will not make them.

- Is there any documentation?
Yes. There are doc files included with the ROM download. 

- I'm stuck in the post game!
There's a post game story guide in the docs. I've tried to make it obvious to tell players where to go but I will keep trying to improve it.

- Will you add in more Pokemon?
Nope. I feel 450 different species is enough and I don't want the game to get bogged down with bloat.

- Will you make Mega Evolutions accessible earlier?
Nope. The game is not designed for them in terms of difficulty curves and story themes. Besides, I feel like they don't add that much gameplay complexity to justify their inclusion and they can distract players from using new features like the multi ability system. 

- Will you increase Pokemon Storage Box size?
Nope. I can't increase the Storage Box size any more due to GBA limitations. I feel 450 spaces is just enough and can work for a living dex anyway.
